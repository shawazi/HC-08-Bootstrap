to-do: 

the form elements are not responsive (in cellphone mode, the form input fields are pushed together and overlapping each other).

the hamburger menu is way too wide when it opens.

icons missing links to social media profiles.

stolen pictures of Justin and Enea, need to ask them for permission or delete their pictures.

the corporation logos (google, deloitte, apple, etc.) are too large. 

the bottom of the page (contact us area) looks too condensed/chaotic (even in regular desktop mode). 

the programming, design, and networking logos change position depending on how many lines of text are underneath each icon. This means that if the first icon has three lines of text underneath, but the other two icons have 2 lines of text underneath each of them, then the first icon will not be aligned along the same axis as the other two icons (due to the text underneath taking up more space). need to adjust divs or css or something
