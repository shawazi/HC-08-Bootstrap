to-do: 

the form elements are not responsive (in cellpone mode, the form input fields are pushed together and overlapping each other).

the hamburger menu is way too wide when it opens.

icons missing links to social media profiles.

stolen pictures of Justin and Enea, need to ask them for permission or delete their pictures.

the corporation logos (google, deloitte, apple, etc.) are too large. 

the bottom of the page (contact us area) looks too condensed/chaotic (even in regular desktop mode).
